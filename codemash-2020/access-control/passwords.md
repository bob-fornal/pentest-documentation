# Logic

Identified MD5 Encryptions, made file with each hash on a line. Then ran ...

\# john --format=raw-md5 passwords.txt --show > decrypted.txt

> `--show` forced it to redisplayed previously decrypted hashes, remove on first run.

> Remove `/root/.john/.john.pot` to completely re-run

> `--fork=6` for parallelism.
